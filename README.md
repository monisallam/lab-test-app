# lab-test-app
This is an app I built with the help of ChatGPT with GPT4

The goal of the app is to allow users to upload Lab Test results in pdf format, and have server side code extract that data into tabular format for tracking, analysis, etc.

As of now, user sign up and authentication is completed using Flask, and the front end code uses vanilla JavaScript.

You can see how I worked on this project with the help of ChatGPT in the txt file in this repository which I exported using Chrome Extension called "Save ChatGPT"
